## 🚀 About Me

I'm a **Senior Mobile Engineer** from Brazil 🇧🇷 with strong expertise in **Flutter**, **iOS (SwiftUI & UIKit)**. I'm passionate about clean architecture, modular app design, and integrating **AI** and **machine learning** into mobile experiences.

I’ve built apps ranging from GPS tracking systems to AI-powered drinking games — always prioritizing **scalability**, **performance**, and great **user experiences**.

I'm a lifelong learner currently pursuing a degree in **Computer Science**, practicing **English daily**, and exploring areas like **cryptography**, **SQLite optimization**, and **local LLMs** for on-device AI.
